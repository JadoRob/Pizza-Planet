# Pizza Planet
By Andrew Hopkins, James Agyemang, Joven Poblete, and Robert Enojado</br>

A Linux project created for the AWS re/Start and NCI 12 week course. Using Linux/Ubuntu, a user will use the command line interface to select a pizza for purchase. The core of the project will be using scripts to simulate the customer experience. Linux concepts and commands learned in the lessons will be incorporated, such as variables, conditionals, and functions.

## Project Requirements
>Youâ€™re to create an executable file and create a pizza place in Linux. Users will have a GUI-like view of the pizza place. Customers should be able to >choose a pizza size, toppings, select either carryout or delivery, see the order summary (including all selections above, subtotal, taxes, and grand total) >and finally place the order. This is expected to be a smooth experience for customers. You are expected to use functions, arrays, loops, conditionals (e.g. >if statements, switch case statements), variables, and commands seen in class. Be creative and innovative. Impress your classmates and your instructor. >Create something beautiful that you can proudly show employers and peers. My expectations are high. I expect a great project from you guys.
